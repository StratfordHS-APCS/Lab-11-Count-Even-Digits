# Lab 11 - Count Even Digits

## Lab Goal
You will be writing a recursive method that will count the number of even digits in an integer.

## Instructions
 * Complete the `countEvens` method to recursively count the number of even digits in an integer.
 * You'll want to use `%` and `/` to separate one digit at a time from the integer.
 * Complete the main method to ask the user for an integer and then output how many even digits there are.
 * Make sure you add a javadoc comment on each method.  You'll need to include a `@param` tag for each method that accepts a parameter.  Include a `@return` tag on any method that returns a value.

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.
* Edit the first line of the Readme.md file and put your username in both locations that say "username".  This is necessary if you want the badge at the top of the instructions to show red or green based on your most recent commit.

## Grading
* 40 - `countEvens` works with a non-recursive solution
* 90 - `countEvens` works with a recursive solution
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
